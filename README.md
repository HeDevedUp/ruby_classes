# School libray 

Imagine a librarian at example University, and need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that I created can allow the librarian to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.

And all of these are built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
